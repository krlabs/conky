# KR. Laboratories Conky Custom Configuration

A customizable and sleek configuration for [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky), the lightweight system monitor for Linux. This configuration offers a modern design, system resource monitoring, and easy customization. Conky monitors can be seamlessly used on desktop like widgets, providing real-time system information directly on your display.

## Features ðŸš€

- **Minimalist Design**: Clean and visually appealing layout.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: CPU, RAM, Disks, Processes, Logs, Network stats.
- **Custom Widgets**: Weather Forecast, Kernel version, OS release, System uptime, and more.
- **Easy Customization**: Modify fonts, colors, and displayed modules to suit your preferences.

## Important Notes

- Some commands in this configuration require `sudo` privileges to execute. Make sure you have the necessary permissions or run Conky with appropriate settings to avoid issues. For example:
  - Commands like `dmidecode` for hardware information may need `sudo`.
  - Ensure your user has access to required files and devices without unnecessary restrictions.
